Climate change refers to long-term shifts and alterations in temperature and weather patterns. These changes have been significantly influenced by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which increases greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere. The impacts of climate change are widespread, including rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Mitigation efforts, such as reducing emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources, are critical to addressing climate change.
