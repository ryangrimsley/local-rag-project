The history of computers dates back to ancient times with devices like the abacus. However, the modern concept of computing began in the 19th century with Charles Babbage, who designed the first mechanical computer. The first electronic computers were developed in the 20th century, leading to the creation of the first programmable computer, ENIAC, in 1945. Over the decades, computers have evolved rapidly, with significant milestones such as the development of the personal computer, the internet, and mobile computing.
