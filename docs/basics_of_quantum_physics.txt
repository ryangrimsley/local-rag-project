Quantum physics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles on the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It challenges our classical understanding of physics with concepts like wave-particle duality, where particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Another key principle is quantum superposition, where a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. Quantum entanglement, another fundamental concept, describes how particles can become correlated in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance between them.
