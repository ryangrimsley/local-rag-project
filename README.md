# local-rag-project

A project I made to learn more about using AI through code, and to expand my knowledge of LLMs and what they can do. 

## Usage

To run the program and interact with the stored files, just run `python3 query.py`. 

To update the database, add whatever txt files you want to the docs directory, and run `python3 populate_database.py`

To reset the database, run `python3 populate_database.py --reset`, using the `--reset` flag to reset.
